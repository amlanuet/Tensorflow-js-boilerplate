# Welcome to my tensorflow.js experimentation

You have downloaded the Tensorflow-js-boilerplate, yay!
This project will be used to make an img recognition program that wil ultimately drive FTC Nederland Robot of Friesland college Team 2.

## I'm using Xammp to run this example but other http hosting will probably work as well, and Xammp will not properly not be the final hosting because it needs to be hosted on the FTC driver hub or device hub.
